Designed an Android App for the following requirements.

Display a list of items to the user based on the following requirements:

Display all the items grouped by "listId"
Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying.
Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.

Made use of Kotlin and the Jetpack Compose MVVM architecture for the same.

Added a unit test to ensure logic was correct. 

Made use of Retrofit, MutableStateFlow and LazyColumn to achieve the expected results.
